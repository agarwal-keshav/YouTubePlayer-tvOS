A Simple YouTube tvOS App

The following is a fork from [@klein-thibault](https://github.com/klein-thibault/StarcraftWatch)'s StarcraftWatch and modified heavily based on my needs. All credits for his work goes to him :) 

Things I modified and added: 
  - Layout tweaks 
  - Connects to [YouTubePlayer-tvOS-backend](https://github.com/NazimAmin/YouTubePlayer-tvOS-backend) to load data using Google OAuth
  - Removed DetailedViewController for faster playback.

### Why? 

I recently bought an AppleTV for my mom. The current YouTube app is a struggle for her to navigate through. So I created this for her making it easier to navigate and watch the only type of videos she likes.
